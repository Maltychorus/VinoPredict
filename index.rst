Documentation of Wine Quality Analysis
======================================

Overview
========

The **Wine Quality Analysis** project evaluates wine quality based on various chemical properties. It involves **data visualization, preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning models** for classification.

Features
========
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualization of wine quality trends.
- **Data Cleaning & Transformation**: Handling missing values and feature scaling.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Evaluating different classifiers (SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree).
- **Performance Evaluation**: Comparing model accuracy and visualizing results.

Key Features

| Feature              | Description                                               |
+======================+===========================================================+
| Data Analysis        | Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** by            |
|                      | summarizing and visualizing key wine properties.          |
|                      | Identify patterns, distributions, and potential outliers. |
+----------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| Feature Engineering  | Categorize wine quality into **three groups** (High,      |
|                      | Middle, Low) for better classification. Normalize and     |
|                      | scale features to improve machine learning model accuracy.|
+----------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| ML Models            | Train and evaluate multiple **machine learning models**   |
|                      | including **Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest,**    |
|                      | and **Decision Tree** to predict wine quality.            |
+----------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| Accuracy Comparison  | Compare the performance of different ML models by         |
|                      | analyzing **accuracy scores, confusion matrices, and      |
|                      | classification reports** to determine the best approach.  |

# VinoPredict
Developed VinoPredict, a machine learning-based system to classify wine quality based on chemical        properties. Implemented data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation techniques to improve classification      accuracy. Optimized the project with Sphinx documentation to ensure clarity, usability, and maintainability.
